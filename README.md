# CSC 212 Term Project: Group 5 â€“ Recursive Graphics
Our project uses recursion to create different fractals: Sierpinski Triangle, Hilbert Curve, and Koch Snowflake.

# Compiling and Running
Since we are using L-Systems, it is important to use the L-System Plotter in this repo. 


Hilbert Curve Code:
-Degrees: 90

Sierpinski Snowkflake:
-Degrees: 72?

Sierpinski Triangle:
-Degrees: 120
